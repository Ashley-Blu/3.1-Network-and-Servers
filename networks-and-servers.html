                    <h2>Understanding Wi-Fi USB Dongles </h2>
                    <p>
                        A <i>Wi-Fi USB</i> dongle is a device that can be used to provide internet connectivity to a
                        computer
                        or even a compatible router. Some routers are equipped with a USB port that can accept a 3G or
                        4G dongle, allowing it to use the cellular network as its internet source. This feature
                        creates a versatile internet setup where the router can failover to the dongle's cellular
                        connection if the primary wired internet (like ADSL or cable) goes down. This allows
                        multiple devices, such as laptops and smartphones, to share the dongle's internet connection
                        over Wi-Fi.
                    </p>
                    <div class="placeholder-image"><img src="assets/dongle.png" alt=""></div>
                    <p>
                        However, it's important to note that not all routers with a USB port support this function; many
                        are designed only for connecting printers or external hard drives. Therefore, when
                        purchasing a router intended for use with a dongle, you must check the product specifications
                        for terms like "3G router" or "USB dongle support" to ensure compatibility with your specific
                        dongle and service provider, such as Tata Photon or Reliance Netconnect. Configuration
                        typically involves connecting the dongle to the router, accessing the router's web-based setup
                        page, and entering the settings for your specific internet service provider.

                    <p>
                        A server is a powerful computer providing data and services to clients. They are fundamental for
                        file sharing, application hosting, and managing network security. They act as the gatekeepers,
                        authenticating users and deploying firewalls to protect the network from external threats.

                    <h3> Types and functions of networking and wireless connection </h3>
                    <p>
                        Modern networking encompasses various methods for connecting devices locally and to the wider
                        internet, each serving different needs. A Local Area Network (LAN) connects devices within a
                        limited area, such as a home or office. Connection to a LAN can be achieved wirelessly using
                        Wi-Fi, which allows devices like laptops, phones, and game consoles to connect without cables.
                        Alternatively, an Ethernet cable provides a wired LAN connection, often delivering a
                        faster and more reliable signal because it is not susceptible to interference that can affect
                        Wi-Fi. Ethernet cables come in different categories, like Cat5e, Cat6, and Cat7, which
                        support progressively higher speeds.
                        A Wide Area Network (WAN), on the other hand, spans a large geographical area and is what we
                        commonly refer to as the internet. Devices can connect to a WAN through several means. A mobile
                        hotspot, created using a smartphone, allows other devices to share its cellular data connection
                        via Wi-Fi. For a more stable setup, a router can be physically connected to the phone
                        to manage the hotspot, providing a better connection without draining the phone's battery.
                        Another method is using a USB dongle, which provides cellular internet directly to a
                        single computer or a compatible router. As cloud computing becomes more prevalent, the
                        distinction between LAN and WAN is blurring, with technologies evolving to create a more
                        seamless, unified network architecture where the physical location of data is less important.

                    <h3>Secure collaborations across the internet</h3>
                    <p>
                        Secure collaboration across the internet relies on robust systems for verifying user identities
                        and controlling access to shared resources. Authentication is the foundational process of
                        confirming that a person or device is who they claim to be, much like a border guard verifies a
                        traveler's passport. In a network environment, this is often handled by technologies
                        like Active Directory, which manages user credentials such as passwords and cryptographic keys.
                        This centralized approach prevents unauthorized access and forms the basis of trust
                        within a network. This trust can be transitive, meaning if Domain A trusts Domain B, and Domain
                        B trusts Domain C, then Domain A will also trust Domain C, creating a secure web of
                        relationships essential for network security.
                        To simplify the user experience without compromising security, Single Sign-On (SSO) is widely
                        used. SSO is an identification method that allows a user to log in once with a single set of
                        credentials and gain access to multiple applications and websites without needing to re-enter
                        their password for each service. This works through a trusted Identity Provider (IdP)
                        that authenticates the user and issues a digital authentication token. This token,
                        often formatted using standards like Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), is then
                        presented to various service providers (like websites or apps) to grant access. This
                        not only enhances productivity but also improves security by encouraging the use of stronger,
                        unique passwords and reducing the risks associated with password fatigue and shadow IT.
                        Ultimately, protecting your personal data—including usernames, passwords, and financial
                        information—from theft is crucial for safe online collaboration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Understanding these distinctions is crucial for designing and troubleshooting network
                        infrastructures, from a simple home setup to a complex corporate environment spanning multiple
                        continents.
